💻 Projects
Some of my projects (finished or unfinished) are already on my github, so feel free to take a look! I have worked mainly on small projects for fun and / or for practicing my skills.

There are a lot of things I want to work on and there are a lot of things I want to learn, I am taking things little by little though there is no reason to rush.
